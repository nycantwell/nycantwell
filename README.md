# Hello World it's Nathan, data scientist and analyst!

## What I do :chart_with_upwards_trend:

* Dive into the data. I genuinely love the wrangling, munging, and cleaning to transform raw data into something structured and clear.
* Programming an optimized machine learning model. Each project I take on requires a unique solution using data industry best practices and tools.
* Visualize key insights from data exploration and modeling. My goal in my projects both professional and personal is to deliver what I have learned to my stakeholders. This almost always comes in visuals and dashboards with a data backed and consise message.

## How I do it :triangular_ruler:

* My primary tools in the data stack are: PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow, Python, MySQL, Apache Spark, PowerBI, and Tableau.
* Within Python I use packages such as: numpy, pandas, sklearn, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Looking ahead :telescope:

* Growing my toolkit and knowledge in the data science and analytics space. There will always be so much to learn!
* Further out the dream path is gathering the experience and skills to be a principal and lead data scientist.
* Coding up my personal projects. Applying my ever growing toolkit to hobbyist ideas in sports and gaming ML and analytics.
* Finding the next great hike. Whether it's a quick weekend trek or a journey through one of our stunning National Parks I love just getting out there!
